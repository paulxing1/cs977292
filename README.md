You are not permitted to copy sentences or paragraphs from tools or software which generate multiple connected ideas in sentences when completing this assessment. This is because we need to assess your ability to develop and organise ideas, in particular, to report and interpret analytical output, and we are unable to do so if you use a tool that does this on your behalf. Examples of such tools/software include (but are not limited to) ChatGPT and Gemini. You may only use these Gen AI tools in the writing process to 1) brainstorm ideas and 2) edit your work. If you use these tools, you must acknowledge them in your work by attaching an Appendix illustrating how you have used them. You may also use Gen AI tools to draw or generate graphs. Such graphs must be clearly acknowledged using citations as indicated on the Quick Cite website. You must reference any use of such tools.
For guidance on how to reference AI generated content in your writing, visit Quick©ite (or by this link: https://www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/2.html).
Please be aware of the limitations of Gen AI tools.

Disciplinary Knowledge and Practice
Written Communication. Background: You are a financial advisor at GSM Bank, based in Auckland, New Zealand. Emily, a 30-year-old data analyst working for a leading tech company, approaches you for advice. She earns a salary of NZD 80,000 and expects an average annual raise of 3.5% with a standard deviation of 0.7%, based on her industry and career prospects. She has been contributing to her superannuation scheme which matches 100% of her contributions up to 3% of her salary. She currently contributes the maximum amount to take full advantage of her employer's match. However, she is uncertain if her current strategy will meet her long-term financial goals. Emily is committed to ensuring her retirement plan aligns with her vision of a comfortable lifestyle. at 65, which she envisions as being financially secure enough to maintain her current standard of living, travel regularly, engage in leisure activities, and have sufficient funds to cover healthcare and other unforeseen expenses in retirement. Emily's current superannuation account is diversified across three different funds: • Stable Bonds Fund (Stable): A conservative fund, investing in government bonds and fixed-income securities, averaging an annual growth of 3.50% with a volatility measure of 4.00% over the past decade. • Balanced Hybrid Fund (Balanced): A balanced fund, with a mix of stocks and bonds, showing a ten-year average growth of 6.50% and a volatility of 8.50%. • SkyHigh Equity Fund (SkyHigh): A growth fund, focusing on equities, with a historic ten-year growth rate of 10.50% and a volatility of 20.50%. She distributes her contributions as follows: 40% into Stable, 40% into Balanced, and 20% into SkyHigh. As her financial advisor, your task is to help Emily develop a strategy for her superannuation fund that optimises her returns while aligning with her risk tolerance and retirement goals. Assignment Tasks: When preparing your report, please ensure that you answer each of the tasks below thoroughly. Structure your report by clearly labelling sections with relevant subtitles corresponding to each question. This will help in organising your findings and arguments systematically. Provide comprehensive explanations, analyses, and justifications for each of your answers, supported by relevant financial theories, data, and calculations where appropriate. Your report should not only present your conclusions but also the reasoning and methodology behind them, allowing for a clear understanding of your analytical process. The tasks are:
Superannuation Strategy Review: a. Evaluate Emily's current investment allocations. Consider the balance between risk and return in the context of her age and retirement goals. b. Assess the sufficiency of her current and projected contributions towards meeting her expected retirement needs. Consider her current salary, expected salary increases, and contribution match from her employer. c. Provide recommendations for any adjustments to her superannuation strategy to better align with her long-term financial goals.
Projection Methodology: a. Propose a method to project the future value of Emily's superannuation fund by the time she retires at age 65. Consider the variability in salary increases and fund performance. Describe how you would account for these uncertainties in your projections. b. Discuss the strategies you would implement to ensure that your analysis covers a wide range of scenarios and remains robust under various conditions.
Analysis Framework: a. Detail the steps you would take to implement your proposed projection method from Question 2 “Projection Methodology”. Describe how you would use this framework to evaluate the potential future value of Emily's superannuation. b. Discuss how you would interpret the results of this analysis, considering various potential retirement scenarios. Final Guidance for Assignment Submission: As you conclude your analysis and prepare your report, please remember: • Implementation and Reporting Guidance: While structuring your report around the specified questions and tasks, ensure the last section is dedicated to effectively communicating your findings. This should be done in a manner that is clear and comprehensible, particularly for Emily, who may not have a background in business analytics. This part of your assignment is crucial for bridging the gap between complex analytical outcomes and practical, actionable advice. • Application of Findings: Additionally, provide a thoughtful discussion on how Emily can leverage the insights gained from your analysis to make informed decisions regarding her superannuation contributions and investment allocations. This discussion should aim to translate your technical findings into strategic recommendations that Emily can easily understand and act upon. This guidance is intended to remind you of the importance of clear communication and the practical application of your analytical work. It is not a separate question or task but a fundamental aspect of how you should approach the overall presentation of your assignment.
